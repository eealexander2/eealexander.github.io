              <h3>Software Engineer, tastyworks </h3>
              <p class="date">August 2016 - June 2018</p> 
              <p>
                I started at tastyworks as a software engineering apprentice. As an apprentice, I focused on completing programming challenges and code reviews with my mentor. Additionally, I started working on simple features for the tastytrade website. 
              </p>
              <p> As a full-time software engineer, I was responsible for planning, implementing, testing and shipping the backend (Ruby Grape API) code for important product features. Specifically, I led the referral marketing program build, and worked on account opening, account, order, and regulatory functionality. My account opening contributions included planning and executing code necessary for margin, foreign, and IRA accounts. The firm's varied account types attracted many different kinds of customers, which in turn drove revenue. My most significant account functionality contributions included the automation of important tax document processing, and writing various account fee, margin and buying power algorithms. My most important work on order routing included creating pre-flight checks (a check to ensure an order is ready to be sent to an exhange), automating order routing and order status updates, and implementing functionality required to offer different types of orders (futures, futures options, etc.). Finally, I was responsible for automating the generation of important regulatory documents to be sent to the exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ). If these documents were incorrect, the firm would be charged a significant fee. We used docker for development, RSPEC for testing, and Chef for deploys. 
              </p>
              <p> Though my efforts were primarily focused on backend tastyworks code, I also oversaw our sister company, tastytrade's  codebase (a Rails project). The tastytrade team and I worked together to plan and execute successful marketing campaigns, and ensure the site was FINRA compliant.  
              </p>
              <p> Finally, I had the opportunity to mentor two interns over the summer. This experience, although not technical, was very rewarding and fulfilling.

              <p class="date">Feb 2016 - June 2016</p>
              <p>The first phase of DBC is remote, so I started the program while I was still working at Sumo Logic. In the remote portion of the program, we focused on mastering data structure, command line, and programming basics. During the onsite porition of the program, we learned object oriented programming, the basics of REST, AJAX, JQuery, basic vanilla JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and agile development best practices. </p>
